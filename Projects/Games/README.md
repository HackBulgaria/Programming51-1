# Classic 2D Games

This project includes building a mashup of two classic 2D games into one. We want you to pick two classic or 8-bit games and create a game using ideas from both games. It will be interesting for us to see the way you think and see you use your imagination in such a project. But if you want a step by step guide you can ask us personally and/or check the things bellow:

## What classic games should we choose?

Examples of classic games are:

* [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)
* [Tetris Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack)
* [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game))
* [Game of Fifteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)
* [Stack attack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.forksel.loader&hl=en)
* [Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bros.)
* [Pinball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball#3D_Pinball_for_Windows_.E2.80.93_Space_Cadet)

## Note

There are many more games that you can use. You have to pick two of these and merge them into one game.

If you need in-depth explanation on any of the games - just ask! I would be more than happy to explain and show it to you!

## Rules

The game you chose should have a 2D visualisation and should be playable with one player.

## Advices

Try to work as much Object Oriented as possible. Working with objects makes game development much easier!

## Help

It is a good idea to first create a simple classic 2D game.

When you feel comfortable with what is happening - then, go and start combining things.
