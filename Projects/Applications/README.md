# Data Structures, Algorithms + Visualization

The main idea here is to implement an interesting data structure or algorithm and use it to create a simple application, using Swing.

You can choose one of the following scenarios:


* [A Dictionary using Trie](1-Dictionary-with-Trie)
* [A Pathfinding with A-Star](2-Pathfinding-with-A-Star)
* [A Simple REPL](3-A-Simple-REPL)
