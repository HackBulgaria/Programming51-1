# Arrays & Vectors - our first data structure

## Static methods

First, we talked about static methods. We recommend looking at the following materials:

* <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html>
* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2671496/java-when-to-use-static-methods>

## Vectors

After this, we started looking at the Vector data structure - a way to overcome the limitations that we have with arrays.

Vectors are fundamental data structures. As materials, you can take a look at:

* [The slides about Vectors](http://slides.com/hackbulgaria/deck-21-22)
* [Implementation of Vector with generic types in Java](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming51-1/blob/master/week4/materials/Vector.java)
