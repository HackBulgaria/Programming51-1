This course comes after Programming0 and before Programming 101. Hence - 51! This will be about OOP &amp; Data Structures.

The language of choice is going to be Java. The reason here is simple - Python's OOP contains too much magic for a beginner to handle. So we are going to use the clasiccal approach with Java!

## Program

**Here is a high-level overview of the program** - what we are going to cover and use in this course:

1. Get familiar with Java - we are going to compare Java with the things we know in Python so far. We are going to talk about types, arrays, IDE, Java Virtual Machine, `public static void main`, etc.
2. Solve some problems with Java - we are going to revisit some of the problems from Programming 0 and resolve them with Java.
3. Introducing OOP. Here, the fun begins. We are going to talk about why does OOP exists, what is the philosophy there and how can we achieve things in Java, using classes, encapsulating data and learning about interfaces and polymorphism.
4. Introducing Abstract Data Structures & starting to think with interfaces. We are going to start with **linear data structures**
5. We are going to implement our first data structure - a `Vector` - a self-resizable array. After this, we are going to implement `LinkedList` - again, a self-resizable list.
6. After this, we are going to do `Queue` and `Stack`, using our previous data structures. We are going to solve a lot of problems involving queues and stacks ;)
7. To merge things, we are going to implement a `Deque` - something that behaves like a `Queue` and a `Stack`!
8. Making our way towards **non-linear data structures**, we are going to implement a mathematical `Set` data structure, the naive way.
9. After this, we are going to jump right into `Trees`, making different kind of search trees - `BinarySearchTree` and `Trie`.
10. After the trees, are are going to take a look into `Graphs` - how to implement them and what are the basics algorithms that we can run there.
11. And to finish the course, we are going to revisit some of the data structures, and implement them better, with the latest knowledge we have.


Also, we are going to cover some of the concepts from the Java language:

* Exceptions
* Generics
* Input / Output
